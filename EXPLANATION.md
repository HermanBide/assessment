## My Approach
> My first approach was to implement a Typescript interface
- **GenerateCompanyStructure**: Create a tree like structure using json data. all employee are store in a treenode which is place under main root (boss)
- **hireEmployee**:
- **fireEmployee**:
- **promoteEmployee**:
- **demoteEmployee**:
- **getBoss**:
- **getSubordinates**:


### Bonus
- **Time Complexity**
- getBoss ( 0(1) )
- getSubordinates ( 0(n) )
- fireEmployee ( 0(n) )
- hireEmployee (0(n) )
- promoteEmployee
- demoteEmployee

    -demote and promote functions can be merge into one since it only envolves swapping employees from different position.
