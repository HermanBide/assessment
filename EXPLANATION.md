### Bonus
  **Time Complexity**
    -getBoss (Best case time complexity of 0(1) )
    -getSubordinates (worst case time complexity of 0(n) )
    -fireEmployee (Avg case time complexity of 0(n) )
    -hireEmployee (Best case time complexity of 0(n) )
    -promoteEmployee
    -demoteEmployee

    -demote and promote functions can be merge into one since it only envolves swapping employees from different position.
